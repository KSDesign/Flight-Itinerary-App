				TravelSmarter - README Instructions
Step 1:
	If this is the first time opening the application, you will need to put the following files before opening the application:
				flights.csv
				clients.csv 
	to the path:
	/storage/emulated/0/Android/data/cs.b07.p3/files/

Step2:
	When the application first time opens, you should log in as the administrator as follows:

			username:admin@gmail.com
			password:password

	and then type flights.csv into "enter file path:" then 
	click LOAD FLIGHT
	and type clients.csv into "enter file path:" then 
	click LOAD USERS

	After this point, you can operate the application as administrator or 
	simply shut down the application when you are done.

	NOTE:
		If you want to view and edit client info, just type the Client's email on the Administrator interface 
		and click SEARCH/VIEW/EDIT CLIENT, you will operate the account as Client

Step 3:
	The application will use the email address as username.
	When logging in as a client for the first time, the initial password that the client typed 
	would be its password.(however, the password can be changed in the app)

	NOTE:
		The client should be in the clients.csv, if not it can not login.

	NOTE: 
		On the search itineraries interface, you must click "Depart date:" to choose the departure date.
